### Project Highlights

### Project Introduction
Power BI is powerful data visualization tool which enables user to work with diverse dataset sources, allows data transformation and supports variety of data visualization graphs and charts. Apart from this, Power BI also gives good user interface to design dashboards and publish them, even on mobile devices with Power BI application. This project mainly intends to understand and use these features.
Credit card defaulters’ data is used for working, in this project. Main idea is to visualize the number of defaulters depending on various demographic features.

### Dataset Description
The data is taken from UCI repository. It is based on research aimed at the case of customers default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among various data mining methods. However, we just want demographic data for visualization. Thus, payment columns will be dropped during transformations. Fake geolocation data column for US states is also added for testing map outline chart features.

The dataset originally has demographic features like gender, education, marital status, and age. These features are expressed as categorical/ numeric values. Data transformations will be conducted wherever necessary and these features will be utilized to test various charts from the tool.
